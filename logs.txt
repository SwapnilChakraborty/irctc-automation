# IRCTC Login Automation - Approach Log

## Environment
- JavaScript (Node.js)
- Playwright
- Chrome headless mode (slowMo for visibility)
- Terminal-based user input for captcha

---

## Phase 1: Planning 

- Reviewed IRCTC login process: discovered captcha, login modal, and session behavior.
- Analyzed network behavior using browser dev tools.
- Decided to avoid image OCR captcha solving due to complexity and limited time.
- Chose Playwright for modern API and headless/stealth capability.

## Phase 2: Development 

- Scripted navigation to https://www.irctc.co.in
- Handled modal login popup and accepted cookies dialog.
- Captured captcha as an image and paused for user to input the text manually.

## Phase 3: Session Management 

- Logged in and navigated to Train Search page after successful login.
- Used `setInterval` with `page.reload()` every 20 seconds to keep the session active.
- Verified cookies and session tokens via Playwright's context.

## Learnings

- Captchas are a challenge in automation without AI/ML or APIs, fallback was manual intervention.
- IRCTC login page is modal-based, so a simple redirect isn't possible â€” had to interact with modal fields.
- Network analysis showed tokens/cookies change on reload, justifying need to refresh session.

## Final Notes

- The solution maintains MVP expectations within 6-hour deadline.
- Deliverables include this log, API documentation, and JS code.
